<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>
Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929, in Indore, Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh). She was the eldest daughter among the five children of Dinanatha and Shevanti Mangeshkar who belonged to a Maharashtrian Brahmin family. 
Dinanath hailed from the town of Mangeshi in Goa and he changed his last name from Haridkar to Mangeshkar to identify with his hometown. Her father Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar was an accomplished classical singer and stage actor. 
Lata was initially named Hema when she was born, but later her father renamed her Lata, inspired by a character in one of his plays. She had four siblings, three sisters, Meena, Asha, and Usha; and one brother, Hridaynath. 
All five Mangeshkar siblings learned classical music from their father.
